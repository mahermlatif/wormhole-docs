# Wormhole TypeScript SDK

## Introduction

The Wormhole TypeScript SDK is useful for interacting with Wormhole connected chains and protocols built on top of Wormhole. This package bundles together functions, definitions, and constants that streamline the process of connecting chains and completing transfers using Wormhole.  The SDK also offers targeted subpackages for Wormhole connected platforms which allow you to add multichain support without creating outsized dependencies.

This section covers all you need to know about the functionality and ease of development offered through the Wormhole TypeScript SDK. Take a tour of the package to discover which functions, definitions, and constants are exposed to make integration easier. Learn more about how the SDK abstracts away complexities around concepts like platforms, contexts, and signers. Finally, you'll find guidance on usage, along with code examples, to show you how to put the tools of the SDK to use.

## Installation

### Basic

Install the (meta) package:

```bash
npm install @wormhole-foundation/sdk
```

This package combines all the individual packages to make setup easier while allowing for tree shaking.  

### Advanced

Alternatively, you can install a specific set of published packages:

??? interface "`sdk-base` - exposes constants"

    ```sh
    npm install @wormhole-foundation/sdk-base
    ```

??? interface "`sdk-definitions` - exposes contract interfaces, basic types, and VAA payload definitions"

    ```sh
    npm install @wormhole-foundation/sdk-definitions
    ```

??? interface "`sdk-evm` - exposes EVM-specific utilities"

    ```sh
    npm install @wormhole-foundation/sdk-evm
    ```

??? interface "`sdk-evm-tokenbridge` - exposes the EVM Token Bridge protocol client"

    ```sh
    npm install @wormhole-foundation/sdk-evm-tokenbridge
    ```
